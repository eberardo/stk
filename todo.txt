-add missing tests (including : failure capture of macromolecules)
-fix them
-implement parallelisation
-implement orientation
-implement fitness function
-implement limited mutation
-implement population storage and initialization from stored populations
-implement chirality check
-write developer's guide
-write user's guide
-make mating and mutation parallel
-add more selection functions
-attributes added to topology as a result of fitness function need to be documented
-create ga test runs
-tests for stochastic sampling and mating determinstic sampling
-tests for init of fixed bb cage/ pop
-change mutation test so that first test initiates from saved population - should lead to a speedup

DONE!
------------
-implement storage of failed initializations/optimizations etc.
