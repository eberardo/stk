    Used to represent the vertices of Cage polyhedra.

    This class stores information about the vertices which make up a
    Cage's structure.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coord : numpy.array of floats
        A numpy array which holds the x, y and z coordinates of the
        vertex, in that order.

    connected : list of Edge or Vertex instances
        This list holds the Edge or Vertex instances which represent
        the edges or vertices connected to the `self` vertex.

    bonder_ids : list of ints
        This list holds the ids of atoms which belong to the building
        block placed on the vertex and will form bonds. The ids reflect
        those in the macromolecule not in the building block itself.

    atom_position_pairs : list of tuples of form (int, Vertex)
        Each atom which  is paired to a neighboring vertex or
        edge first. Only after this is the atom - atom pairing
        performed. The atom - edge/vertex pairing is stored here. The
        int represents the id of the atom.

    distances : list of tuples of form (float, int, int)
        After bonder atoms have been associated with vertices to which
        they join, the idividual atoms are paired up. To do this the
        distance between every bonder atom on the paired vertex and the
        bonder atom which is paired to the vertex is found. This
        information is stored here where float is the distance, the
        first int is the bonder atom and the second int is the bonder
        atom on the vertex paired to the first atom.

    id : object, optional
        An id to identify the vertex. Used by `place_mols()`

        The orientation of the building block is aligned with 2
        parameters. Firstly, the normal of the plane of bonder atoms of
        the building block is aligned with the normal of the plane
        formed by the edges connected to the vertex. Because the normal

class _CageTopology(Topology):
    """
    A topology class which cage topologies should inherit.

    Attributes
    ----------
    In addition to all the attributes defined within ``Topology`` this
    class has the following attributes:

    A_alignments : list of ints (default = None)
        The length of this list must be equal to the number of
        building blocks in the cage. When cages are built one of the
        bonder atoms of each building block is aligned with an edge
        during placement. The int indicates which bonder atom is
        aligned. The int corresponds to an index in `bonder_ids`.

        If ``None`` the first atom in `bonder_ids` is always aligned.

        For example,

            A_alignments = [0,2,1,2]

        In this case there must be 4 building blocks in the cage. The
        the first building block has its first (index 0) bonder atom
        aligned. The 2nd building block has the 3rd (index 2) atom
        aligned. The 3rd building block has the 2nd (index 1) atom
        aligned. The 4th building block has the 3rd (index 2) atom
        aligned.


    B_alignments : list of ints (default = None)
        The length of this list should be euqal to the number of
        linkers in the cage. The linkers of a cage can have either 2
        functional groups or 3 or more, depending on the topology.

        When the linkers have 2 functional groups the list should hold
        either 1 or -1. The value indicates that the linker is aligned
        parallel or antiparallel with the edge its placed on. For
        example in a tetrahedral topology,

            B_alignments = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

        It indicates that the first linker is aligned anti parallel and
        the second is aligned in parallel, and so on.

        If the linkers have 3 or more functional groups, the values
        in B_alignments have the same role as `A_alignments`. The only
        difference is that by default the second atom is aligned,
        rather than the first.

    edge_alignments : list of ints, optional
        The length of the list is equal to the number of building
        blocks in the cage. Each element is an int which holds the id
        of an edge. For example,

            edge_alignments = [1, 2, 3, 4]

        then the first building block is aligned with the edge with
        `id` of 1, the second building block is aligned with the edge
        with `id` 2 and so on. For this to work the edge defined by
        the class must have their `id` attributes defined.
