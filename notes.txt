- There is an additional ``chirality`` that is not being considered. Consider two building blocks joined by a linker:

BB1 -- A__B -- BB2

where A__B is the linker, A and B are the atoms which join to the building block atoms.

The building blocks can also be joined with the linker rotateded by 180 degrees:

BB1 -- B__A -- BB2.

Should this be taken into account somehow?
